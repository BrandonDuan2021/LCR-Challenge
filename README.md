# Welcome to my challenge code!

I used react + scss to complete this challenge for the following reasons:

1. React can provide great modularity to the project. Components can be written in different jsx files, and powerful hooks can provide great global variable accessibility.
2. React can provide high cohesion and low coupling to the project. Hooks such as useContext make sure that global variables won't need to be passes when calling functions. Also each React component only need to contribute to one feature.
3. SCSS makes sure that the css codes can be nested, makeing styles more readable and managable.
4. I just wanna showcase my react ability since my vanilla js, html, css skills can be checked out at [Brandon's Page](http://www.shuhongbrandonduan.me) or even more at [Brandon's TaskForge](http://www.shuhongbrandonduan.me/task-manager/) üòÅ

   I tried my best implementing both responsive and adaptive design, and I hope you enjoy my project!
